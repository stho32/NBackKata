- There is a ![[Stream of Stimuli]]
- The [[subject]] is then presented the characters from the [[Stream of Stimuli]] one at a time. 
  
- In the time, each character is presented, the [[subject]] has to decide wether it is a repetition or not.

- A character is considered a repetiton when there is the exact same character n characters back in the [[Stream of Stimuli]]. (n is set in the [[configuration for a test]]).
  
- Thus every character in the [[Stream of Stimuli]] is an expected decision by the [[subject]]. The [[subject]] can give the correct or the incorrect answer. 
	- We call the first list of answers the "expected [[Stream of Answers]]", whereas the second one is the "Subjects [[Stream of Answers]]". Both are expected to be equal for a perfect result.

- If no decision is made by the [[subject]], it counts as "not a repetition". (Depending on how the user interface decisions are made it can be that there is no way to specify an input method for "not a repetition", so I figure that is the most likely interpretation).
  
- One of the results of the test is a [[Percentage of Correct Answers]].
